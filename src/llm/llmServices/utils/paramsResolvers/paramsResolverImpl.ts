/**
 * The base class that implements the parameters resolving algorithm and provides
 * a convenient way to declare your custom parameters resolvers.
 *
 * How to use it.
 * 1. Declare a custom class that extends `ParamsResolverImpl` with the right generic types:
 *    the `InputType` is the type of the input object to resolve and
 *    the `ResolveToType` is the type of the output resolved object.
 *
 * 2. Specify each property resolver in the following format:
 *    ```
 *    readonly resolveToParamKey = this.resolveParam<PropertyType>(inputParamKey)
 *        . // continue building the single parameter resolver with the hints
 *    ```
 *    Notes:
 *    * `resolveToParamKey` should be a name of one of the `ResolveToType` properties (and should not start with "_");
 *    * `inputParamKey` should be a name of one of the `InputType` properties;
 *    * you can also use `this.insertParam<T>(...)` and `resolveNestedParams<ParamInputType, T>(...)`
 *    instead of `this.resolveParam<PropertyType>` to start building the parameter resolver. Check their docs for more details.
 *
 *    Once you finish building the parameter resolver, it should implement `ParamsResolver<InputType, any>`
 *    (i.e. should be a finished parameter resolver) &mdash; most likely, it will be of
 *    the `AbstractSingleParamResolver<InputType, PropertyType>` class.
 *
 *    Implementation note:
 *    * if you need to declare any utility properties in your class,
 *      it is okay to do by starting the proeprty name with an underscore (for example, `_utilityProp`).
 *
 * 3. Check that all resolvers for the `ResolveToType` properties are specified correctly. To do this, make your
 *    parameters resolver class implement `ValidParamsResolverImpl<InputType, ResolveToType>`. It will check exactly this contract.
 *
 * 4. Specify an Ajv JSON schema for `ResolveToType` and pass it to the `super(...)` constructor. So far it is needed to
 *    properly validate the properties inside the resulting resolved object. *TODO: make `ParamsResolverImpl` generate such a schema.*
 *
 * 5. Call `resolve(inputParams: InputType): ParamsResolutionResult<ResolveToType>` method of your custom class
 *    to validate the `inputParams` parameters robustly and efficiently. The parameters resolver has no visible inner state,
 *    so can be called multiple times with no side-effects.
