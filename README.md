`Coqpilot` is a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that is designed to help automate writing of Coq proofs. It uses Large Language Models to generate multiple potential proofs and then uses [coq-lsp](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp) to typecheck them. It substitutes the proof in the editor only if a valid proof is found. 

Now `coqpilot` is in early beta and seeks for feedbacks. Please feel free to open an issue regarding any problem you encounter or any feature you want to see in the future.

## Requirements

* `coq-lsp` version `0.1.8+8.19.0` is currently required to run the extension.

## Brief technical overview

`Coqpilot` fetches proofs from multiple completion services. Now we support: 
- a service that always returns a list of pre-defined in the settings tactics/coq sentances.
- an [open-ai](https://openai.com) gpt service.
- a service that fetches completions from the model, running locally in LM Studio.
- a service that uses Grazie platform (only for JetBrains employees for now).

For each service, an array of models could be defined through the settings. Each model will be used for generation independantly. This brings freedom to the user to experiment with different model parameters, e.g. temperature, prompt, etc.

When `CoqPilot` completion command is issued, it parses the currently opened file, extracts theorems that have complete proofs and processes them into a message history for the LLM. It helps LLM to keep the style and hallucinate less. 

For each `admit.` present in the file, an independent completion process is issued. If a valid proof is found, it is substituted in the editor. `CoqPilot` also allows a multi-round fixing procedure for the proofs from the LLM. I.e. if the proof was incorrect, compiler message could be automatically sent to the LLM with a request to repair it. It can now be configured in the settings. One can set the amount of attempts for the consequtive proof fixing with compiler feedback.

As soon as at least one valid proof is found, it is substituted in the editor and the process is finished.

**Notice:** By default, coqpilot sets only `predefinedProofs` and `open-ai` services. The first one tries `auto.` tactic and the second one has one model -- `gpt-3.5`. By default the `apiKey` for open-ai is not set, i.e. set to `None`. Do not forget to change that in the settings before using this service.

**Notice:** File `settings.json` declares not all the settings, but those that are overriden from the defaults. Keep that in mind, if you want, for example, to turn off the `open-ai` service. For that, you would need to override the corresponding setting with an empty array, but not delete this property from the file.

## Example usage

`Coqpilot` only runs on an opened `coq` file. User can:
- Run `coqpilot` with some chosen selection to try substitute all admits in this selection.

- Run `coqpilot` to try substitute all admits in the file.
- Run `coqpilot` to substitute the proof for the admit if there is one under the cursor.

## Installation

### Coq-lsp installation

To make the extension running you will have to install `coq-lsp` server. You can install it using opam: 
```bash
opam pin add coq-lsp 0.1.8+8.19.0
opam install coq-lsp
```
For more information on how to install `coq-lsp` please refer to [coq-lsp](https://github.com/ejgallego/coq-lsp). 

With coq-lsp, extension should have everything it needs to run.

### Building locally

To build the extension locally, you will need to have `npm` installed. Then you can clone the repository and run the following commands:
```bash
npm install
npm run compile
```

To run the extension from the vscode, you can press `F5` or click on `Run extension` in the `Run and Debug` section. It will open a new window with the extension running.

To run all tests properly (i.e. with rebuilding the resources and the code first), execute the following task:
```bash
npm run clean-test
```

If you do not want to build test resources (a small coq project), to execute all the tests that don't use them you can run: 
```bash
npm run test-ci
```

To run specific tests, you can use `npm run test -- -g="grep pattern"`.

<!-- ## Architecture

The extension's architecture overview is stored in the [ARCHITECTURE.md](https://github.com/JetBrains-Research/coqpilot/blob/refactor/ARCHITECTURE.md) file. It will be extended and updated as the project evolves. -->

## Important 

Coqpilot generates aux files with `_cp_aux.v` suffix. Sometimes when generation fails with exception, it is possible that such file will not be deleted. When a project is open, extension shall show a window that asks if you want to add such files to the local project gitignore. 

Moreover, this repository contains a script for your convenience that adds the format of such files to the global gitignore file on your system.  
- Copy the [`set_gitignore.sh`](https://github.com/K-dizzled/coqpilot/blob/main/set_gitignore.sh) file to your computer. Then: 
```bash 
chmod +x set_gitignore.sh
./set_gitignore.sh
```
It will add the format of coqpilot aux files to your global gitignore file on the system, so that even if coqpilot forgets to clean files up, they will not be marked as new files in git.
Comment: Such files are not visible in the vscode explorer, because plugin adds them to the `files.exclude` setting on startup.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `coqpilot.contextTheoremsRankerType` : The type of theorems ranker that will be used to select theorems for proof generation (when context is smaller than taking all of them). Either randomly or by distance from the theorem, with the currently generated admit. 
* `coqpilot.loggingVerbosity` : Verbosity of the logs. Could be `info`, `debug`.

* `coqpilot.openAiModelsParameters`, `coqpilot.predefinedProofsModelsParameters`, `coqpilot.grazieModelsParameters` and `coqpilot.lmStudioModelsParameters`:

Each of these settings are modified in `settings.json` and contain an array of models from this service. Each model will be used for generation independantly. Multiple models for a single service could be defined. For example, you can define parameters for two open-ai gpt models. One would be using `gpt-3.5` and the other one `gpt-4`. CoqPilot will first try to generate proofs using the first model, and if it doesn't succeed, it will try the second one. This way coqpilot iterates over all services (currently 4 of them) and for each service it iterates over all models. 

## Guide to Model Configuration

### How VsCode settings work

A common way to change the settings, contributed by the extension, is to open the `settings.json` file, or click `Edit in settings.json` on some field in settings UI. Say, by default extension contributes field (setting) `A` with default state `a'`. When you click edit, this field is being copied to the `settings.json` file with the value `a'`: 
```json
{
    "A": "a'"
}
```
From that moment and until you completely remove this field from the `settings.json` file, this will be the source of truth for this setting. Once again, if you want to set the value of the setting `A` back to the default, you have to remove this field from the file completely.

### Model configuration

As mentioned in the previous section, at the moment, four services are supported. 

By default, only `predefinedProofs` and `open-ai` services are enabled. The first one tries `auto.` tactic and the second one has one model -- `gpt-3.5`. Models for other services are defaulted with empty arrays. That denotes that we do not create any models from these services. 

Each and every service is configured with an array of independent models. This was made to easily experiment with different models and their parameters. 

The simplest service to configure is `predefinedProofs`: 
```json
{
    "coqpilot.predefinedProofsModelsParameters": [
        {
            "modelId": "predefined proofs",
            "tactics": [
                "reflexivity.",
                "simpl. reflexivity.",
                "auto."
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
The `modelId` property may be any string you like, but it should be unique for each model. This way, CoqPilot will be able to correctly tell you which model might have configuration issues.

The most commonly used service is `open-ai` (`grazie` and `lmStudio` are configured very similarly). 
```json
{
    "coqpilot.openAiModelsParameters": [
        {
            "modelId": "openai-gpt-3.5",
            "modelName": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0301",
            "temperature": 1,
            "apiKey": "***your-api-key***",
            "choices": 10,
            "systemPrompt": "Generate proof...",
            "maxTokensToGenerate": 2000,
            "tokensLimit": 4096,
            "multiroundProfile": {
                "maxRoundsNumber": 1,
                "proofFixChoices": 1,
                "proofFixPrompt": "Unfortunately, the last proof is not correct..."
            }
        }
    ],
}
```
Don't forget to set up the `apiKey` field, by default it is set to `None`. Moreover, make sure that your open-ai key is valid and has enough credits to run the models. If you create a free version of the key, it will not work (it has some weird limitations like 5 requests per inf). You can check you key here: https://platform.openai.com/playground/chat. If the playground works, the key is probably valid.

Multi-round profile setting configures the number of attempts to fix the proof if it is incorrect. If the proof is incorrect, the compiler message is sent to the LLM with a request to repair it. The number of round attempts for one proof is set by `maxRoundsNumber`. The number of choices for the proof fixing is set by `proofFixChoices`. By default, values are set to 1 and that means that **NO** attempts to fix the proof are made. That means that proof is only being generated once. That's equivalent to say that multi-round fixing is turned off. 0 is not a valid value for `maxRoundsNumber` nor for `proofFixChoices`.  

Another thing to keep in mind: We are still in beta and changes in settings may occur pretty often. When that happens, and your re-defined settings (which are stored aside from the extension) are not updated (by hand), this can lead to exceptions. Keep in mind that if you get an error or plugin does not start after the update, you may want double check the settings. Easy way is remove the setting completely in `settings.json`, e.g. `openAiModelsParameters`, than go to the UI, click `Edit in settings.json` on the `openAiModelsParameters` field. It will fill up with updated default values. Afterwards you can re-define the settings as you want.
